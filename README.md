This is a java based project that uses modules and jlink to create a command line application and GUI that does symmetric encryption. This is for my own edification and personal use. I do not recommend that you use it for anything important.


+ `gradlew clean jlink` - Builds the jar files and creates the application runtimes. Adding `-Pjlink_compress=true` will create a smaller runtime footprint.
